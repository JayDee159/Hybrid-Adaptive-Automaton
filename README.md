Hybrid-Adaptive-Automata is a Python library implementing an adaptive, learning-based automaton that combines rule-driven transitions with online graph expansion. It is ideal for symbolic AI, diagnostics, automated control, and data-driven state machine research.

Features
Hybrid transition system: Supports rule-based and adaptive learning

Automatic state creation: Handles unknown sequences by expanding its graph

Custom transition actions: Hooks for side effects and logging

Terminal state support: For accept/reject scenarios

Online learning: Prune underused logic and simulate in sandboxes

Ontology and metadata linking: Bind states to external concepts

Statistics tracking: Visits, transitions, and usage metrics

Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/JayDee159/Hybrid-Adaptive-Automata.git
cd Hybrid-Adaptive-Automata
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: No external dependencies required for core use; demos may require jupyter for notebooks.

Quickstart Example
python
from src.hybrid_automaton import HybridAutomaton

HA = HybridAutomaton(start_state="START")
HA.add_transition("START", "FEVER", predicate=lambda s, st: s == "fever")
HA.add_transition("FEVER", "FLU", predicate=lambda s, st: s == "cough")
HA.states["FLU"].is_terminal = True

result = HA.run(["fever", "cough"])
print("Diagnosis:", "FLU" if result else "Unknown")
Automaton Evolution
The model can create new states automatically during input runs:

text
START --[rash]--> S3 --[sneeze]--> S4 --[fever]--> S5
  \
   --[fever]--> FEVER --[cough]--> FLU(TERMINAL)
See model_card.md for details about use cases and limitations.

Usage
Place your automaton code in src/hybrid_automaton.py

Run tests in tests/test_hybrid_automaton.py

Use examples/demo_run.py for reference usage patterns

Adjust the automaton graph and predicates as needed for your domain
