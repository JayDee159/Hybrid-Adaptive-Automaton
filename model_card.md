**Model Name:** Hybrid Adaptive Automaton  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Overview

Hybrid Adaptive Automaton implements a Python-based, adaptive state machine capable of symbolic reasoning, state expansion, and online learning. It is intended for diagnosis, symbolic AI research, automated controllers, and educational purposes.

---

## Intended Use

- Symbolic artificial intelligence applications
- Adaptive diagnosis and expert systems
- Educational tool for automata theory or learning state machines
- Prototyping adaptive, rule-augmented workflows

---

## Model Architecture

- Rule-based state transitions using predicates
- Automatic state/transition creation for unseen inputs
- Terminal and non-terminal state handling
- Statistics tracking: visits, hits, pruning logic
- Ontology/metadata links for states

---

## Data & Limitations

- **No data bundled**
- Model learns topology from provided input sequences
- Not suited for deep learning, continuous streams, or large-scale language modeling

---

## Evaluation & Testing

- Includes sample runs, sandbox simulation, and pruning
- Core tests in `tests/` directory

---

## Ethical Considerations

- Not for direct use in medical or safety-critical deployments without further validation
- Intended for research, education, and proof-of-concept only
